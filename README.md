# AI Basics

This repository contains **fundamental AI concepts** through a structured implementation of **game AI and decision-making agents**. The project includes:
- **Optimal decision-making algorithms** for navigating a grid-based environment.
- **Agent-based simulation** with pirates, treasures, and marine obstacles.
- **Pathfinding and reinforcement learning techniques** to optimize movement.
- **Utilities for AI-driven gameplay mechanics**.

The code leverages Python libraries such as **NetworkX, NumPy, and itertools** to create efficient search and optimization strategies for intelligent agents.
